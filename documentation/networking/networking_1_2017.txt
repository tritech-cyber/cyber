12)  Who sets world networking standards?


!  You need to start designing two computers. 
Document your parts on a google doc and save it in your google docs networking folder. One computer will be for OFFICE (simple) and one will be for GAMING.  You also could design a CAD computer or server. If you design a MAC goto Apple.com and customize a MAC.  Keep track of the prices!!  The price list is the most critical part of this lesson.

Go to https://pcpartpicker.com/ , https://www.newegg.com/ or https://www.amazon.com/ to pick out parts.  You might need help from someone who has built a computer.  Parts required:
- MOTHERBOARD
- CPU (AMD OR INTEL)
- RAM
- POWER SUPPLY
- CASE
- HARD DRIVE (SATA, SSD, PCI-E OR M.2)
EXTRAS (VIDEO CARD, SOUND CARD, OR DVD)
