Adding multiple classes:

Hey Craig, 

Thanks for reaching out. 

1. There is a way of dividing your course into multiple class periods or sections. 
Follow these instructions from our Help Center that explain how to have your students 
enroll into those multiple sections. Please let me know if any of your current students 
need to be divided since we'd have to divide them on our back-end using your roster.

2. If a student wants to drop your course later in the school year, please email the Edhesive support team at support@edhesive.com. 
Be sure to have your section token readily available and identify in the email which student you would like removed.
Please allow up to 2 business days for all roster changes to be completed.

Best,
Fermin Villalpando
