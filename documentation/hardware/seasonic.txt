Thank you for contacting Seasonic.

First of all, please make sure to only use our cables with our PSU's as each brand got its own pinouts. Compatible cables like Cablemod.com can be also used as long as your model is listed on their website. This said, to find our original cables, you can visit our partner's website, BTOS:
