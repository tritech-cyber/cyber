First, you want to communicate with your nighbour system, you need a physical connection.

i.e Cables, coax—-> Physical layer

Even though you are connected physically, you need to address yourself.

i.e MAC —-> Datalink Layer

MAC is a Physical Address for your device through which devices in a network identify yours.

Basically ethernet, wifi, wimax etc…

Now you have a MAC and Physical connection, all you need is a logical address

i.e IP —-> Network Layer

IP of a system is not permanent, when you use DHCP or when your ISP uses DHCP.

It is a temporary address given to your system. You can have a dedicated IP for your system, that costs you.

Now, you have a good setup of network with physical links and address but how do you communicate?

All you need is a protocol which transfers data from your system to another.

i.e TCP, UDP —-> Transport Layer

There should be an intermediate node which manages the setting up and taking down of the association between two communicating end points that is called a connection.

i.e SIP, RTP —-> Session Layer

The data that flows in a network will be in the form of 1’s and 0’s, so there should be a node which translates those 1’s and 0’s to plain text (human readable format) and if necessary compression and decompression. This is done by presentation layer

i.e Jpeg Mpeg —-> Presentation Layer

Finally, What you see in your monitor is the final application and the result of the combination of all these protocols.

This can be done by some specific protocols like…

http, https —-> Application Layer
