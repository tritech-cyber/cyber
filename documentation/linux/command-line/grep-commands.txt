grep -rnw '/home/cwc/http/wooten/' -e '#fdcc52'

 -r, --recursive
              Read  all  files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic links only if they are on the command line.  Note that if no file operand is given, grep searches the working 
directory.
              This is equivalent to the -d recurse option.
       -n, --line-number
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.

   -w, --word-regexp
              Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.  The test is that the matching substring must either be at the beginning of the line, or preceded by a  non-word  
constituent
              character.   Similarly,  it  must be either at the end of the line or followed by a non-word constituent character.  Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.  
This
              option has no effect if -x is also specified.

 -e PATTERN, --regexp=PATTERN
              Use PATTERN as the pattern.  If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the -f (--file) option, search for all patterns given.  This option can be used  to  protect  a  
pattern
              beginning with “-”.
