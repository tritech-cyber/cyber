Difference between SATA I, SATA II and SATA III
What is the difference between SATA I, SATA II and SATA III?
SATA I (revision 1.x) interface, formally known as SATA 1.5Gb/s, 
is the first generation SATA interface running at 1.5 Gb/s. 
The bandwidth throughput, which is supported by the interface, 
is up to 150MB/s.

SATA II (revision 2.x) interface, formally known as SATA 3Gb/s, 
is a second generation SATA interface running at 3.0 Gb/s. 
The bandwidth throughput, which is supported by the interface, 
is up to 300MB/s.

SATA III (revision 3.x) interface, formally known as SATA 6Gb/s, 
is a third generation SATA interface running at 6.0Gb/s. 
The bandwidth throughput, which is supported by the interface, 
is up to 600MB/s. 
This interface is backwards compatible with SATA 3 Gb/s interface.

SATA II specifications provide backward compatibility to function 
on SATA I ports. SATA III specifications provide backward 
compatibility to function on SATA I and SATA II ports. 
However, the maximum speed of the drive will be slower 
due to the lower speed limitations of the port.

Example: SanDisk Extreme SSD, which supports SATA 6Gb/s 
interface and when connected to SATA 6Gb/s port, 
can reach up to 550/520MB/s sequential read and sequential 
write speed rates respectively. However, when the drive is 
connected to SATA 3 Gb/s port, it can reach up to 285/275MB/s 
sequential read and sequential write speed rates respectively.
