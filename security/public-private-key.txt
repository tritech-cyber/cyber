A public key is only used to encrypt messages not decrypt. A public key 
is published so that anyone can send a particular receiver a secure 
message.

A private key can be used to decrypt messages encrypted with a matching 
public key. As the term suggests, private keys are intended to be 
secret.

Asymmetric Encryption
Asymmetric encryption is a technique that allows anyone to send 
encrypted messages to a receiver. It is based on cryptographic 
algorithms for generating matching pairs of public/private keys such 
that the private key can't be guessed from the public key.
The public key is then published using techniques such as digital 
certificates. The private key is configured in encryption enabled 
software and kept secret.

Symmetric Encryption
Symmetric encryption is based solely on private keys. For example, 
symmetric encryption may be used to encrypt data in storage. It is also 
used in communications by sharing private keys between endpoints.
In many cases, asymmetric encryption is used to initialize a session and 
exchange private keys. Then communication is encrypted with symmetric 
encryption. This is done because symmetric encryption is faster than 
asymmetric encryption.
